#### This 1-hour long project will take you step by step to create a portfolio website. You will learn the basic components of a website, and how to create simple contents using HTML (hypertext markup language) and CSS (cascading style sheets), and how to host it on a popular developer website called “GitHub” with your own subdomain name!

#### By the end of the project, you will be hosting a website that you can use to showcase your work and your résumé to the world!
